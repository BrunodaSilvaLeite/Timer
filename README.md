## 🚀 Technologies

This project was developed with:

- Typescript
- NodeJs
- React(vite)

## ⏱️ Project

The 'Timer' ⏱️ project is an integral part of the [Ignite](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/ignite/react-js-2022) course, offered by Rocketseat. This project provided us with the opportunity to learn and apply a variety of concepts and technologies related to React ⚛️. Some of the topics covered include the use of styled-components, react-hook-form, zod, react-router-dom, and contextapi. We also explore the use of hooks and the importance of immutability, for which we use the immer library.

The main purpose of this project is to promote concentration. It works as a timer that records the time dedicated to a specific project, as well as keeping a history of completed projects. So you can track your progress and stay focused on your tasks.
